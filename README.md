Dvorak for Devs
===============

A keyboard layout based on Programmer Dvorak <https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/> for MacOS.

The project file is in [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) format, where you can modify the layout as you please.

One feature of this particular format is that turning on CAPS lock will temporarily change the number row back to "normal", which I've found useful to enter in PINs, etc..

See also <https://github.com/jayliu50/dvorak-for-devs> for a sister project for Windows.
